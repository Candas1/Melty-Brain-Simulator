# Melty Brain Simulator

This is an attempt to simulate a melty brain robot (tranlational drift) and evaluate impact of different parameters using P5.js visualisation.

### Control
When entering the simulation, the robot is not translating, changing the rpm will only change the rotation speed.<br>
Click in the grey ring to select the desired drift angle, click in the center to return to initial position.
You can also use the arrows on your keyboard.
